        Did you know that there are 3 types of lead climbing? They are aid
        climbing, sport climbing, and trad climbing which stands for
        traditional!

    <p style="max-width: 850px">
      You will probably be toproping unless you have had the proper training and
      have the skills. If that is the case, I don't even know why you are still
      on this website!
