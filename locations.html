    <h3>Place decriptions</h3>
    <p>
      <li class="desc">
        Powerlinez is a great location. the rock is of good quality and is
        chock-full of quartz crystalls. this does make the rock sharp so be
        carful where the rope is.
      </li>
      <li class="desc">
        Birdsboro is a fun place too with a nice variety of walls and
        difficulties. you MUST have lead clibing skill to climb there. it is
        sport climbing only. it is also a big bowl wich makes it pretty chilly
        in the fall so make sure to bring a coat.
      </li>
      <li class="desc">
        Ralph stover is very popular. the rock is sandstone and some popular
        walls are polished smooth. it offers a wide varity of topropes, trad
        routes and a couple of difficult (and sketchy) sport routes.
      </li>
      <li class="desc">
        Finally, Alamuchey is mainly granite. it does not have a very wide
        varity of climbs becuase of it's size. It is berfect for the toprope
        beginner.
