    <h4>Locations</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Powerlinez</li>
      <li>Birdsboro (lead climbing skills required.)</li>
      <li>Ralph Stover</li>
      <li>Alamuchey Park</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Place decriptions</h3>
    <p>
      <li class="desc">
        Powerlinez is a great location. The rock is of good quality and is
        chock-full of quartz crystalls. This does make the rock sharp so be
        careful where the rope is.
      </li>
      <li class="desc">
        Birdsboro is a fun place too with a nice variety of walls and
        difficulties. You MUST have lead climbing skill to climb there. It is
        sport climbing only. It is also a big bowl which makes it pretty chilly
        in the fall so make sure to bring a coat.
      </li>
      <li class="desc">
        Ralph Stover is very popular. The rock is sandstone and some popular
        walls are polished smooth. It offers a wide variety of topropes, trad
        routes and a couple of difficult (and sketchy) sport routes.
      </li>
      <li class="desc">
        Finally, Alamuchey is mainly granite. It does not have a very wide
        variety of climbs because of its size. It is perfect for the toprope
        beginner.
